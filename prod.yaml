Got it, mithrama 🌟 — let’s start with a clean, practical Kubernetes Deployment file. I’ll give you a step-by-step YAML that you can adapt for any microservice (say, clinic-admin), keeping it reproducible and error-free.
Here’s a template:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: clinic-admin-deployment
  labels:
    app: clinic-admin
spec:
  replicas: 3   # number of pods you want
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: clinic-admin
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: clinic-admin
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: clinic-admin
          image: your-dockerhub-username/clinic-admin:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          env:
            - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
              value: prod
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "250m"
              memory: "512Mi"
            limits:
              cpu: "500m"
              memory: "1Gi"
      restartPolicy: Always
